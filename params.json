Please feel free to use and modify to make the code more concise.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ chmod u+x\r\n$ ./script_name\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using iozone script for benchmarking of GlusterFS\r\n\r\nThe code runs iozone with different block sizes and 16 active client threads, using an 8GB file size to test. To minimize the effects of caching, you should benchmark I/O performance using a file size at least twice the RAM installed on your servers. you can limit the amount of RAM seen by the kernel to 2GB—for example, by passing the mem=2G kernel option at boot. To identify where the system is constrained, run sar and iostat in separate terminals for each GlusterFS node:\r\n\r\n**sar -n DEV 2 | egrep \"(IFACE|eth0|eth1|bond0)\"**\r\n\r\n**iostat -N -t -x 2 | egrep \"(Device|brick)\"**\r\n\r\nKeep an eye on the throughput of each network interface reported by the sar command above. Also, monitor the utilization column of the iostat output to check whether any of the bricks are saturated. The commands gluster volume top and gluster volume profile provide many other useful performance metrics.\r\n\r\n###Copyrights\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2013 (@ZeeshanMunir) This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of Apache Common License as published by Apache Foundation.\r\n\r\n###Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with scripts?
